# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository (`my-first-claude`) currently containing only basic documentation. The repository appears to be a starter or learning project for working with Claude Code.

## Current Structure

- `README.md` - Basic project documentation
- This repository currently has no build system, dependencies, or code files

## Development Notes

Since this is a minimal repository, development commands will depend on what technology stack gets added. Common patterns to consider:

- If adding Node.js: `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`
- If adding Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python -m pytest`
- If adding other languages: Update this file with relevant build and test commands

## Future Development

When code is added to this repository, update this CLAUDE.md file to include:
- Build and test commands
- Code architecture and patterns
- Development workflow specific to the chosen technology stack
